# On hiatus because I'm currently using AtlasOS
# clean11
My custom autounattend file with tweaks for Windows 11 for a more pleasant experience overall. ðŸš€

# What tweaks?
## OOBE and Windows installer tweaks:
- Bypass Windows 11 requirements (TPM, Secure Boot, etc.)
- Allow Windows 11 to be installed without a network connection (runs OOBE\BYPASSNRO automatically)
- Uses a generic product key, and skips EULA and goes straight to partition setup in the installer.
- Defaults to local account creation during OOBE.
- Prevents automatic device encryption on a fresh install.
- Disables all express settings by default in OOBE.
- Removes all Windows 11 tiles by default after a fresh install.
- Disables app suggestionsâ€‰/â€‰Content Delivery Manager
- Language set to English (India).
- Interactively set PC name after install.

## Windows 11 tweaks:
- Removes preset icons from the taskbar. (MS Edge, MS Store, Explorer, etc.)
- Icon only search in taskbar by default. (Can be changed of course, it just looks cleaner to me that way.)
- Always show file extensions in Explorer.
- Disables widgets entirely.
- Uses classic context menu.
- Left-aligned taskbar.
- Sets startup page of Windows 11 to "This PC" from "Home".
- Disables Bing in search.
- Disables fast startup.
- Allows execution of PowerShell scripts by default.
- Disables last access time stamp updates in NTFS.
- Prevents Windows Update from doing automatic reboots.
- Disables Edge's first run experience. (Might show "This browser is managed by your organization" but it's pretty harmless and should be ignored.)
- Disables "Enhance Pointer Precision" mouse setting.

# Windows Defender:
- Gone. Modify it on your own if you want to remove Defender.

# How do I use it?:
- Couldn't find anything better than [memstechtips's guide on the same.](https://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall?tab=readme-ov-file#old-methods)

# Who is this intended for?
- It's intended for intermediate-advanced users and it enables quite for risky stuff like automatically enabling PowerShell scripts, etc.
- It's intended for people who know what they are doing and are aware of the modifications this autounattend script can do.
- It's intended for people who are willing to go out of their comfort zone to make an overall more pleasant Windows experience for them.<br><br>

**IT IS NOT A HEAVY MODIFICATION TO WINDOWS! It's exactly identical to a fresh Windows 11 install. Comparing it to AtlasOS, ReviOS, Ghost Spectre doesn't do it justice. It's a bunch of small modifications and registry tweaks to Windows. Each and every thing can be restored to default after the installation and it does not break anything at all.** <br><br>

**Use at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage caused.** <br>
**I will look out for updates and changes to Windows and try to update it, if it causes anything to break, please make an issue about it.** <br><br>

**I was able to achieve this using [schneegans.de's autounattend.xml generator](https://schneegans.de/windows/unattend-generator/).** <br><br>

This project was greatly inspired by memstechtips' UnattendedWinstall script. I would highly recommend you check it out too [UnattendedWinstall](https://github.com/memstechtips/UnattendedWinstall). It has more heavier modications to Windows and a lot of changes to it. If you want something with only a small amount of changes on a stock Windows 11 install, I would still recommend you use my xml since his script is for advanced users.
